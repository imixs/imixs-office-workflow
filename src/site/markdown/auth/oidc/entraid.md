# Secure Imixs-Office-Workflow with Microsoft Entra ID & OpenID Connect

The recent release of Imixs-Office-Workflow for Wildfly includes native support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) via the elytron-oidc-client subsystem. OIDC is an identity layer that enables clients, to verify a userâ€™s identity based on authentication performed by an OpenID provider. For example, you can secure Imixs-Office-Workflow using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) as the OpenID provider.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a Microsoft Azure account with an active subscription (find details below)

Add the following Maven dependency into your custom build. This will include the Imixs-Office-Worklfwo OIDC Module:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.imixs.workflow</groupId>
        <artifactId>imixs-office-workflow-oidc</artifactId>
        <version>${org.imixs.office.version}</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
```

This will build a version including the library `imixs-office-workflow-oidc-*.jar`. This optional module provides the OIDC Security bean with the corresponding '@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition'.

**Note:** Make sure that the application deployment descriptor `jboss-web.xml` and `jboss-ejb3.xml` did not set the `<security-domain>`! This will overwrite the OIDC setting and will break the authentication flow.

The configuration of the OpenID Provider Endpoint and the client secret can be done by setting the following environment variables in your Docker image:

```
      OIDCCONFIG_ISSUERURI: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/v2.0"
      OIDCCONFIG_CLIENTID: "<YOUR-MICROSOFT-CLIENTID>"
      OIDCCONFIG_CLIENTSECRET: "<YOUR-CLIENT-SCRET>"
```

The data needed here is from the Microsoft System.
