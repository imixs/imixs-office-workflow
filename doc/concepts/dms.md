# DMS

Imixs Marty provides a DMS Feature which allows the search form documents. The behavior is controlled by the DMS-Plugin.


	org.imixs.marty.plugins.DMSPlugin

## Search Feature

In Imixs-Office-Workflow the search feature (located in the top service nav) can be activated by setting the imixs.property:

	dms.search=true

This property is a default property.
 
Note: Make sure that the field 'dms_names' is added into the Lucene Index!
